# Expanding List Experiment

This is a living training excersize by [Jakob Skjerning](http://mentalized.net).

The goal is to familiarize myself with writing Javascript for the browser,
implementing the same UI widget using a few different
approaches/methods/frameworks.

Nothing here is meant for general reuse, although - if you insist, I guess you
could.

## The widget

The target widget is a list of input fields that keeps expanding so at least one
blank field is always present for the user to type in.

## Feedback

I'm thrilled to receive code reviews, improvement suggestions, feedback, pull
requests. I am sure your Javascript-fu is stronger than mine, so teach me.
